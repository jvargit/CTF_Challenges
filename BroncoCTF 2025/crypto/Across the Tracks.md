# Across the Tracks - crypto 

## Challenge

I've been working on the railroad, all my live long day. We really should put up a fence, a deer just ran onto the tracks in a zig-zag pattern. After crossing my tenth track tracing the deer, I have found this message! What could it mean?

## Solve

Simple challenge, looking at hints we just use railway cipher with a key of 10:

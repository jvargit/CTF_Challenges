# C3 - cryptography

## Case

This is the Custom Cyclical Cipher!

Ciphertext:

```
DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl
```

Encoder:

```py
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(out)
```

## Solution

To begin with, I began to trace the encryption process to see if it could be reversed:

1. Grab index where a given character is stored in `lookup1`, store in `cur`
2. Compute (`cur` - `prev`) % 40, with `prev` beginning as zero
3. Map the result of this to `lookup2`, selecting the character at `lookup2[result]`
4. Set `prev` = `cur` and repeat throughout string

These steps can be reversed to engineer a decryption algorithm:
1. Identify index `ind` where a given character in the ciphertext is stored in `lookup2`
2. Compute (`ind` + `prev`) % 40
3. Map the result of this to `lookup1`, selecting the character at `lookup1[result]`
4. Set `prev` = `ind` and repeat throughout string

I wrote the following code to achieve this:

```py
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

ciphertext = 'DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl'
deciphered = ''

prev = 0
for c in ciphertext:
    ind = lookup2.index(c)
    adjusted = (ind + prev) % 40
    plain = lookup1[adjusted]
    deciphered+=plain
    prev = adjusted

print(deciphered)
```

Running this code provides the following output:

```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```

Quickly fixing the typo in the line for printing characters, I saved this output in both a code file `encrypt.py` as well as a text file `input.txt` and reran the code on its own plaintext representative:

```
python encrypt.py input.txt
```

This produced the output:

Which could be wrapped to reveal the flag:

# To Infinity and Beyon - osint

## Challenge

Um so we kind of forgot the address to this place that Elira really likes so.... could you find it please? Thank yoouuu. I remember it was somewhere in the city but we visited it ages ago and only took a photo of the outside.

Note: Flag is in format cysea{address} e.g. "123 Sesame Street, Sydney" would be cysea{123SesameStreetSydney}

## Solve

Searching by image on Google returned Infinity Tower Brisbane. Checking the address of the building returned the flag:

`cysea{43HerschelStreetBrisbane}`

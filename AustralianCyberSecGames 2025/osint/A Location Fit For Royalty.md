# A Location Fit For Royalty - osint

## Challenge

Comrade Elira Voss visited a beach recently that she wants to hold our final hoorah at. She loves to be by the ocean. She remembered it might have been named after a royal or something? I'm not sure, but it was a great cliffside view. I have a photo but couldn't remember the name of the beach.

Flag is in format cysea{name_of_beach}. It is case insensitive.

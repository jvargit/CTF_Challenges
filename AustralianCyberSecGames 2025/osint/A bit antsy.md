# A bit antsy - osint

## Challenge

This giant insect is terrifying. Can you help us find the town where this is located, the animal it's based on and its size?

Flag is formatted cysea{town_animal_size}. E.g. cysea{ningaloo_whaleshark_18.8m}

## Solve

Searching by image on Google returns the following [article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-21/the-big-root-and-10-more-obscure-australian-big-things/9415936).

This identifies the ant is from Augathella, and searching further identifies a size of 7.5m:

`cysea{augathella_meatant_7.5m}`

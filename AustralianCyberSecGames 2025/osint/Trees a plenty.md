# Trees a plenty - osint

## Challenge

Okay we're a little lost.... I thought driving through the middle would be easy, okay?? Not my fault I failed geography... Can you help us find where we are?

Flag is in the format cysea{RoadName_Latitude_Longitude} eg cysea{TallRoad_-33.774_151.114}. Latitude and longitude is to nearest 3 decimal places.

## Solve

This was the OSINT challenge from hell... 

The challenge title and description quickly led us to the Plenty Highway in the Northern Territory of Australia - 500km of fairly identical desert landscape.

The rectangular yellow sign and 2017 Google copyright tag were the only clear differentiating factors. My teammate `prab` narrowed the search down to the right side of the highway by considering the position of the clouds and sun. 

Credit to `prab` for finding the location and flag:

`cysea{PlentyHighway_-22.496_137.253}`

## Challenge

If I'm going to be the next Prime Minister, I need to act like it. I need to get in touch with nature and my Prime Minister nature. What better way to do that then going on a brisk walk?

Note: Find the coordinates of the image to 3 decimal places. For example: cysea{-34.066_151.012}

## Solve

With the hints in mind looked for some Australian walks relating to prime ministers and found [Prime Ministers Walk](https://www.mypacer.com/routes/oi2i00/prime-ministers-walk-trail-bexley-new-south-wales)

Going along the trail with Street View showed an identical path, took the latitude and longitude and eventually got the correct flag:

`cysea{-33.944_151.119}`

# Trees of Gold - crypto

## Challenge

My friend Katie wrote this Language of Trees which is truly fantastic... Well it would be if I understood it at all, she sent me this letter before she ever taught me how to read this new language she made. Could you help me decipher it?

## Solve

Assigning a random letter to each tree in the image gives the string:

`abcd ef cgfdhciec'f jcdekjci dhll?`


Inputting this into a [frequency analysis tool](https://www.dcode.fr/monoalphabetic-substitution) outputs the question:

`What is Australia's national tree?`

The answer is wrapped for the flag:

`cysea{acacia_pycnantha}`
